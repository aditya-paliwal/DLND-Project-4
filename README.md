# Project Title

 Language translation from English to French

## Introduction

This was my fourth project in 17-week Udacity Deep Learning Nanodegree Foundation. In this project, I trained a sequence to sequence model on a dataset of English and French sentences that can translate new sentences from English to French. The project was written in python (on a Jupyter Notebook) in Anaconda environment.

This project involved the building of a Sequence-to-Sequence model by implementing the following functions below:

- model_inputs
- process_decoder_input
- encoding_layer
- decoding_layer_train
- decoding_layer_infer
- decoding_layer
- seq2seq_model

The complete implementation can be seen in notebook file (project+4+code.ipynb)

### Prerequisites

The requirements are listed as:

- Python3
- Anaconda
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries (numpy, tensorflow)

### Installing

#### Step-1

Install the above prerequisites by running the following command:

conda install numpy  jupyter notebook


#### Step-2

Create the new environment by running

conda create *env name*

#### Step-3
